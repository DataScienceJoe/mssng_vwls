To do:

- Customise it a lot, better GUI, etc. [Maybe involves using a different framework than Streamlit, e.g. Flask]
- Create ability to scroll between questions -- not just always start from Q1
- Add in a scoring system
- Incorporate statistics (timing, etc.)
- Scale up to multiple people
- Deploy online
