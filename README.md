in scripts/ you can find the file that scrapes past OC missing vowel questions and stores them in a file in /data
main.py is a prototype minimal buzzer for the missing vowels questions


To do:
- Customise it a lot, better GUI, etc. [Maybe involves using a different framework than Streamlit, e.g. Flask]
- Create ability to more easily change between questions -- not just always start from Q1
- Add in a scoring system
- Incorporate statistics (timing, etc.)
- Scale up to multiple people
- Deploy online
- Play the game with teammates
- Win Only Connect
